Hello all! Quick one today, sorry for the hastiness.

I just want to let you know of live stream on YouTube. A live stream so fantasic that it'll knock your socks off. Yes, the Snapcraft team is hosting a live stream at 3pm Eastern (or 8pm Greenwich Mean Time, convert it, there is tools out on the net) that shows you how to snap stuff! That's a little vague, I'll try again. The Snapcraft team shows you how to package up your applications that you have built into Snap packages and they can be submitted to the Snap store. How neat is that?!

I found this on the [Twitters](https://twitter.com/snapcraftio/status/1095351083462021121) and I thought I might chare this with all of you so you get on the bandwagon on why Snap packages are the bomb dot com. 

That's all and I hope to see you there!
